Hi!  I'm Alyssa, and I'm interested in the ways people argue, learn from each other, and make sense of their place in the world on the Internet.  In particular, I love studying niche subcultures like Reddit's Swoleacceptance, The Discourse on Tumblr, and Tumblr fandoms.  I just graduated from MIT in 2017 with a joint degree in Comparative Media Studies and Computer Science.  Right now I'm working at a startup in Cambridge as a software engineer.
