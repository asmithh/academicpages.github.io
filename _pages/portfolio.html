<b> <a href = 'asmithh.scripts.mit.edu/levy.html'>Random walks based on keystroke timing noise </a>:</b> my first project in Javascript!
Uses the last few decimal places of keystroke timing as a source of randomness to draw a Levy flight.
The high-precision timing module doesn't work consistently well in Chrome.

<b>January 2015 Internship at Open Technology Institute</b>:
In which I <a href = 'https://github.com/asmithh/broadband-map'>attempt</a> to <a href = 'https://github.com/asmithh/naive-bayes-broadband'>figure out</a> what demographic factors are correlated with good broadband access and <a href = 'https://github.com/asmithh/cost-of-connectivity'>try and fail</a> to scrape telecom providers' websites.</p>
<b> <a href = 'https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwqMTKEi7jpJFqnwm8p0D-BdVXnB4bvd0554E8jugGo/edit?usp=sharing'>"Knitting the Cozy Sweater of Identity"</a>:</b>
My CMS.400 (Credit for Reddit) final paper (a team effort with Allan K. and Aaron S.), featuring a physical data visualization, figuring out how to understand how people think, and some not-so-well-hidden existential dread.   Also featured in a MIT admission <a href = 'http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/how-to-choose-your-major'> blog post </a> by Allan.

<b> <a href = 'https://github.com/asmithh/gothic-gravitons'>that weird Twitter bot I made once</a>:</b>
This is the source code I threw together for a Twitter bot that combines the infamous Harry Potter fanfiction <em>My Immortal</em>, an extract from <em>A Brief History of Time</em> by Stephen Hawking, and another excerpt from Faulkner's <em> The Sound and the Fury </em>.  On Twitter <a href = 'https://twitter.com/gothicgravitons'> here </a>

<b> <a href = 'https://github.com/asmithh/moon-orbits-earth'>Simulation of tidal bulges in the event of an improbable apocalypse</a>:</b>
Project for introductory physics done in Processing -- an animation of the Earth's tidal bulges if the moon were to (near-impossibly) come twice as close to Earth at perigee.
